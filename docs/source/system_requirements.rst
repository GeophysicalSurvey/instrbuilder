System Requirements 
**************************

Follow system requirements for `PyVISA <https://pyvisa.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_nivisa.html#getting-nivisa>`_. A VISA driver is required, a convenient option is the driver available from National Instruments:

* `Windows <http://www.ni.com/download/ni-visa-18.0/7597/en/>`_

* `Mac OS X <http://www.ni.com/download/ni-visa-18.0/7599/en/>`_

* `Linux <http://www.ni.com/download/ni-visa-16.0/6185/en/>`_

**Tested**:

* Instrbuilder has been tested on Mac OS X with Python 3. 
 
* Testing of other operating systems is on the TODO. 

* We are also testing the native Python VISA driver package `PyVISA-py <https://pyvisa-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.
