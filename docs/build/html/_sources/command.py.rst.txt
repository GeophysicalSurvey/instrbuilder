instrbuilder: INSTRUMENT BUILDER
========================================================


Instrbuilder is a python library for quickly generating easy to use instrument drivers. The
library targets instruments that use `SCPI <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Commands_for_Programmable_Instruments>`_ (Standard Commands for Programmable Instruments) 
and are interfaced to with packages such as `pyvisa <https://pyvisa.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ or `pyserial <https://pythonhosted.org/pyserial/>`_.
