# Background
``instrbuilder`` is an open-source Python package for control of electrical instruments. This package eases the development of high-level "drivers" to interface with oscilloscopes, power supplies, function generators, multimeters, or any instrument that uses ASCII textual string communication (such as SCPI [@scpi1999standard]). ``instrbuilder`` is particularly suited for prototying and automating experiments in research laboratory setups within an IPython terminal. Our goals are to quicken the development of automated data collection so that laboratory experiments are more reproducible.

# Summary
``instrbuilder`` reads and writes instruments with serial or USB interfaces and leverages the consistency of SCPI commands so that new instrument "drivers" can be created with a simple CSV file (example command files are included in the package). 
An example read:
```python
fg.set('offset', 0.5)
```
and an example write:
```python
offset = fg.get('offset')
```
Non standard instrument commands may also be generated by writing Python code. Each instrument object is compromised of a communication handle and a list of commands. Each command may be automatically tested for communication errors or unexpected return values and stores a help string. To support experimental reproducibility, commands are classified as to whether they configure the state of the instrument so that a complete archive of the instrument configuration may be automatically read and logged. Instrument addresses and other environment properties may be stored in a YAML system configuration file so that the user may name each instrument and simply open instruments by name. ``instrbuilder`` supports the user with the generation of the YAML system configuration file. 

Documentation is online https://lucask07.github.io/instrbuilder/build/html/ and [examples](https://github.com/lucask07/instrbuilder/tree/master/instrbuilder/examples) are available in the GitHub repository. These minimal working examples (MWEs) include control of a function generator, power supply, oscilloscope, lock-in amplifier, and an integrated circuit (IC) interfaced to with an Aardvark controller. 

``instrbuilder`` supports a Register class that targets registers of an IC. The IC class objects include a dictionary of the registers and have methods for reading and writing these registers via SPI or I2C. 

``instrbuilder`` is part of a Python software suite that uses Bluesky [@Arkilic2017] and associated modules created for x-ray science by a team at the NSLS-II (see https://nsls-ii.github.io/) to generate an instrument and experiment control environment that facilitates reproducible experiments. A full length manuscript that describes and demonstrates the use of ``instrbuilder`` and ``Bluesky`` is in press. ``instrbuilder`` is available at pypi.org and can be installed with pip.
