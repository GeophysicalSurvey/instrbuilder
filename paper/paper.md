# Background
``instrbuilder`` is an open-source Python package for electrical engineering instrument control. This package eases the development of high-level "drivers" to control oscilloscopes, power supplies, function generators, multimeters, and other instruments that use ASCII textual string communication (such as SCPI [@scpi1999standard]). ``instrbuilder`` is particularly suited for research laboartory experimental setups that may be prototyped in the IPython terminal. 

# Summary
``instrbuilder`` leverages the consistency of SCPI commands so that users may create new instrument "drivers" using a spreadsheet application to edit a CSV file of the commands. Of course, instrument commands may also be generated by writing Python code. Commands can be automatically tested for communication errors or unexpected return values. ``instrbuilder`` displays help on each instrument command sorted by subsytem. Commands are classified as to whether they configure the state of the instrument so that ``instrbuilder`` may read and log a complete archive of the instrument configuration. 

``instrbuilder`` supports a Register class that targets registers of an integrated circuit. The IC class supports reading and writing these registers via SCPI or I2C. 

Instruments addresses may be stored in a YAML configuration file within the user's home directory so that the user may create a name for each instrument and open the instrument using that name. Documentation and examples are available online. The repository contains simple minimal working examples for a Function Generator, Power Supply, Oscilloscope, LockIn Amplifier, and an Integrated Circuit interfaced with an Aardvark controller. 

``instrbuilder`` is part of a package that uses Bluesky to generate an instrument and experiment control environment that facilitates reproducible experiments. A full length manuscript that describes and demonstrates this effort is in press.
